          <h1>Summary</h1>

          <p>
            We'd like some help creating a tabbed card component for showing small sets of information to users on demand.
          </p>

          <h2>Motivation</h2>

          <p>
            After doing some customer interviews, we noticed that many users found the amount of information on the product page a little overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'd like to use a little "tabbed card" for this information instead so users only see one section at a time.
          </p>

          <h2>Design</h2>

          <p>
            I've attached some designs below for Desktop and a rough skeleton of how it might look on Mobile. I'm happy to leave the rest up to you folks.
          </p>

          <h2>API Examples</h2>

          <p>
            I don't quite know yet, but it'd be nice if we can make it flexible so we can use it for other sections not just the product information.
          </p>

          <p>
            We'll probably want to be able to have it open on a different tab by default depending on where the user is coming from, if that helps.
          </p>

            Looks good Kat!
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember we'll have to give this an accessibility once-over too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wonder, will a tab ever be there but be empty or disabled? What will happen in that case?
          </p>
        </Speech>

        <Speech character={jessica} comment>
          <p>
            I like the extra action at the bottom. Will all tabs have one and I guess they'll be different for each tab?
          </p>

          <p>
            I've seen some similar tabs in the Artist section, they're not connected to a Card like this though but it's something to think about.
          </p>

          <p>
            Am I right in assuming that the content of each tab will all be provided by the consuming app?
          </p>
        </Speech>

        <Speech reverse character={serjio}>
          <p>
            I'm interested in what happens if we have too many tabs to fit across? Or is that just a guideline that we put in the documentation?
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyway, I think there's enough here for the Design System team to have a go at implementing a first pass of this.

        <li>You don't have all the answers, so make some assumptions, try some things out - it's ok to make mistakes.</li>
        <li>Don't sweat the visual details too much.</li>
        <li>Code the way you like to code</li>
        <li>We'll pair on your code later on in the interview process</li>
